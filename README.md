# THE CARDANO CONSTITUTION

**We the Community** of the Cardano Blockchain, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Fairness, insure financial Liberty,
provide for the common defence of the Network, and promote its proper Functioning for ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish
this Constitution for the Cardano Blockchain of the World.

## Article. 1.

### Section 1: Governance Bodies

All governance powers granted hereby will be vested by the Cardano Governance Bodies, which will consist of a Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives and Stake Pool Operators.

### Section 2: Constitutional Committee

The Constitutional Committee of the Cardano blockchain shall be composed of more than `minCCSize` number of members from anywhere around the world, chosen by the  ("New constitutional committee") governance action thereof, for the duration of `termLimits` protocol parameter; and each Committe members shall have one vote.

Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the ("New constitutional committee") governance action enactment, and they shall treat each others as equally as may be during every meetings.

No Person shall be a Constitutional Committee member who shall not have attained the majority according to the law and standard of their respective country, and been one year an ADA Holder of the Cardano Blockchain, and who shall not, when elected, hold a position of political power in any country of the world.

No Constitutional Committee member shall be anything other than a human being.

No Committee member shall, under any circumstances, share their hot and cold keys with anyone, and no person shall vote on their behalf at any time while serving as a member of the Constitutional Committee.

No Constitutional Committee member during a ''state of no-confidence'' who was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to be involved in what caused the community to ratify the ''Motion of no-confidence'' governance action, shall have the right to apply as a member of the next Constitutional Committee. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from the current Committee and the impossibility of being part of the next one under the Cardano Blockchain. 

### Section 3: Delegated Representative

The Delegated Representative shall be chosen at any time by the people of the Cardano Community, and shall be registered as such on the Cardano Blockchain. They represent themselves and those who have delegated their stake to them.

The Delegated Representative can be of any age without restrictions and shall be identified by a credential that can be either a verification key or a native/plutus script. 
Any person, artificial intelligence or script can be a Delegated Representative. 

No Delegated Representative shall be required to identify themselves at any time in order to represent the community, and every person can choose his Delegated Representative according to their personal criteria. The trust and responsibility for this choice rests entirely with the delegates thereof.

### Section 4: Stake Pool Operator

The Stake Pool Operators shall represent themselves, the well-being of their stake pool and their delegates. They can be of any age without restrictions, shall be registered as such on the Cardano Blockchain and shall be identified by using their pool's ID, their cold verification key and signing key, and they may vote on governance actions with multiple stake pool credentials they own.

### Section 5: Elections

The Times, and Manner of holding Elections for the Constitutional Committee, shall be prescribed on-chain by the ("New constitutional committee") governance action, its metadata and the Governance group's protocol parameters values. 

A successful election of a new constitutional committee, a constitutional change or a hard-fork delays ratification of all other governance actions until the first epoch after their enactment to give the new constitutional committee enough time to vote on current proposals, re-evaluate existing proposals with respect to a new constitution, and ensures that the in principle arbitrary semantic changes caused by enacting a hard-fork do not have unintended consequences in combination with other actions.

The Constitutional Committee shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting location shall be determined unanimously by its members.
No Constitutional Committee members shall have their cold keys in their possession when attending to these meetings.

## Article VII

The Ratification of the governance action ("Updates to the Constitution"), shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the Cardano Governance Bodies so ratifying the Same.

## First Amendment

The Cardano Governance Bodies shall not submit or vote in favor of any governance action that serves to promote the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the community to submit governance actions and to petition the Governance Bodies for a redress of grievances.

## Second Amendment

The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights should not be interpreted as denying or denigrating other rights retained by the people of the community.

## Third Amendment

No person shall, at any time, through the governance system or a hard fork, take control or block, without the consent of the owner, the assets thereof, but in a manner that will be prescribed by the law of the owner's country which shall not modify the Cardano blockchain protocol in any way.
